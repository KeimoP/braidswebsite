### What to Include:

Create a screenshot showing:
1. **Top section**: Your homepage hero with the MV Braids logo and tagline
2. **Middle section**: A glimpse of the featured styles or gallery
3. **Bottom section**: A service card or Instagram feed preview

### How to Create:

**Option 1: After Site is Live**
1. Navigate to your homepage
2. Take a full-page screenshot (use browser extensions like "Full Page Screen Capture")

**Note**: Without a screenshot, WordPress will show a default "no screenshot" placeholder, but the theme will still work perfectly. Add the screenshot when you have good photos ready.
